## ya_converter

A clunky program written in Java 1.8, for converting YARG color profiles to Clone Hero color profiles.

# usage

1. get the .jar file from the newest release
2. open cli
3. navigate to where the jar file is
4. run `java -jar [jar file name]`
if it complains about the version ensure you are running it with java 1.8.

# how to build

1. get the code with git clone or download zip or whatev
2. run build.sh

have a day

# Rough todo list

- add ui
- add .bat for Windows users that want to build I guess
